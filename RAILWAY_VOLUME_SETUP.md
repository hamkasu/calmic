## 🚀 Quick Fix (2 Minutes) - NO MANUAL CONFIG NEEDED!

### **Step 1: Open Railway Dashboard**
Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard

### **Step 2: Find Your PhotoVault Service**
Click on your PhotoVault project → PhotoVault service

### **Step 3: Add Volume (That's It!)**
1. Click **"Settings"** tab (left sidebar)
2. Scroll down to **"Volumes"** section
3. Click **"+ New Volume"** button
4. Railway will show a modal - just click **"Add"** or **"Create"**
   - **No mount path needed** - Railway sets it automatically
   - **No environment variables** - App auto-detects!

### **Step 4: Automatic Redeploy**
Railway automatically redeploys. You'll see in logs:
```
✅ Railway Volume detected and mounted at: /data
   Files will be saved to: /data/uploads
   Storage: Persistent (survives restarts) ✅
```

### **Step 5: Clean Up Old Records (Optional)**
After volume is mounted, remove orphaned database records:

**Option A - Via Railway Shell** (recommended):
1. Go to your service in Railway
2. Click **"Deploy"** → **"View Logs"**
3. Click **"Shell"** tab
4. Run:
```bash
python cleanup_orphaned_photos.py
```

**Option B - Via Railway CLI** (if installed locally):
```bash
railway run python cleanup_orphaned_photos.py
```

**Option C - Skip cleanup**:
- Old placeholders will remain in gallery
- New uploads will work perfectly
- Users can delete old placeholders manually

---

## 🧪 Test It Works

1. **Upload a new photo** (web or mobile app)
2. **Manually restart** Railway service:
   - Settings → **"Restart"** button
3. **Check photo still shows** after restart ✅

If the photo persists = **Volume working!** 🎉

---

## 📊 Before & After

### **Before (No Volume):**
```
Storage: Ephemeral ❌
Photos after restart: GONE 💥
Database records: Orphaned 🗑️
Gallery: [Placeholder] [Placeholder]
```

### **After (With Volume):**
```
Storage: Persistent ✅
Photos after restart: STILL THERE 🎉
Database records: Valid ✅
Gallery: [Photo 1] [Photo 2] [Photo 3]
```

---

## 🎯 How Auto-Detection Works

PhotoVault now checks environment variables in this priority:

1. **`UPLOAD_FOLDER`** (manual override if you set it)
2. **`RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH`** + `/uploads` (auto-detected!)
3. **Local `uploads/`** folder (fallback for dev)

**You don't need to set anything!** Just add the Railway Volume and the app automatically uses it. ✨

---

## ⚡ Advanced: Manual Override (Optional)

If you want to customize the path, you can still set:

```bash
# In Railway Variables section:
UPLOAD_FOLDER=/data/my-custom-uploads
```

But this is **completely optional** - auto-detection works great!

---

## 🔍 Verify Volume is Working

After adding the volume and redeploying, check your Railway logs for:

```
✅ Railway Volume detected and mounted at: /data
   Files will be saved to: /data/uploads
   Storage: Persistent (survives restarts) ✅
```

If you see this message = **Everything is working!** 🎉

---

## 💡 Important Notes

1. **Old photos are gone**: Files uploaded before the volume can't be recovered
2. **Database cleanup recommended**: Use `cleanup_orphaned_photos.py` to remove orphaned records
3. **Re-upload needed**: Users need to upload photos again after volume is set up
4. **Future uploads safe**: Once volume is mounted, all new photos persist forever! ✅

---

## 📱 What You'll Notice

### **Immediately After Adding Volume:**
- App redeploys automatically
- Logs show "Railway Volume detected" ✅
- New uploads go to persistent storage

### **After Cleanup (Optional):**
- Old placeholders removed from gallery
- Database clean and accurate
- Only photos with actual files shown

### **Going Forward:**
- Upload photos with confidence
- Restart Railway anytime - photos stay safe
- No more "Photo Placeholder" issues! 🎉

---

## 🎯 Summary

**Problem**: Railway deletes uploaded photos on restart  
**Cause**: No persistent volume configured  
**Fix**: Add Railway Volume (app auto-detects it!)  
**Time**: 2 minutes ⚡  
**Manual config needed**: NONE! 🎉  
**Cost**: Free (included in Railway plan)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **Photos still showing as placeholders after adding volume?**
1. Check Railway logs for "Railway Volume detected" message
2. Make sure volume was added to the correct service
3. Verify app redeployed after adding volume
4. Run cleanup script to remove orphaned database records

### **Not seeing volume in Railway?**
1. Make sure you're in the correct service (PhotoVault, not database)
2. Look under Settings → Volumes
3. Railway Hobby plan includes volumes for free

### **Want to verify configuration?**
Run diagnostic script via Railway Shell:
```bash
python railway_diagnose.py
```

Look for section "4. File Storage Configuration" - should show ✅

---

**Next Step**: Add Railway Volume now → Redeploy happens automatically → Test upload → Done! ✅
