# Subscription Feature Fix - Deployment Summary

## Problem Fixed
Your iOS app was showing a 500 error when trying to load subscription plans from the Railway production server.

## Root Cause
The subscription API endpoints were trying to access database columns that don't exist in your schema:
- Code was looking for: `ai_enhancements_per_month`, `family_vaults_limit` 
- Your actual database has: `ai_enhancement_quota`, `max_family_vaults`

This caused `AttributeError` crashes whenever the iOS app tried to fetch subscription data.

## Solution Applied
Updated the mobile API endpoints to use the correct column names with robust error handling:

### Files Changed
- `photovault/routes/mobile_api.py` - Fixed both `/api/subscription/plans` and `/api/subscription/current`

### Key Improvements
1. **Safe column access** - Using `getattr()` with fallback defaults prevents crashes
2. **Correct column names** - Now using `ai_enhancement_quota` and `max_family_vaults`
3. **Proper fallbacks** - Returns sensible Free plan values if data is missing
4. **Better formatting** - Feature descriptions now display correctly

## Local Testing
✅ Code changes tested on local Replit server
✅ Subscription plans table verified (4 plans seeded)
✅ Endpoints return valid JSON
✅ Architect reviewed and approved

## Next Steps - Deploy to Railway

### Option 1: Deploy via GitHub (Recommended)
```bash
git add photovault/routes/mobile_api.py
git commit -m "Fix subscription endpoints - use correct database columns"
git push origin main
```

Railway will automatically deploy the changes.

### Option 2: Manual Railway CLI
```bash
railway link
railway up
```

### After Deployment
1. **Test the endpoints** with a real auth token:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
        https://storykeep.calmic.com.my/api/subscription/plans
   ```

2. **Verify in iOS app**:
   - Open the app
   - Navigate to Subscription Plans
   - Should see 4 plans without errors
   - Current subscription should display correctly

## Database Status
Your Railway database already has the correct schema:
- ✅ `subscription_plan` table exists
- ✅ `user_subscription` table exists
- ✅ All 4 plans seeded (Free, Personal, Family, Pro)
- ✅ Correct column names: `ai_enhancement_quota`, `max_family_vaults`

**No database migrations needed!** Just deploy the code fix.

## What This Fixes
- ✅ Subscription Plans screen loads without errors
- ✅ Shows all 4 subscription tiers (Free, Personal, Family, Pro)
- ✅ Displays correct pricing and features
- ✅ Shows user's current plan correctly
- ✅ Upgrade flow will work when clicked
