## Deploy to Railway

### Step 1: Test Locally First
The changes are already running on your local Replit Expo Server. Test the new dashboard:
1. Scan the QR code with Expo Go
2. Login to your account
3. Check the dashboard - you should see the Dad Joke card instead of diagnostic info

### Step 2: Commit Changes to Git
```bash
git add StoryKeep-iOS/src/screens/DashboardScreen.js
git commit -m "Remove diagnostic info and recent photos, add Dad Joke of the Day"
```

### Step 3: Push to Railway
```bash
git push origin main
```

Railway will automatically:
- Detect the push
- Rebuild the application
- Deploy the updated iOS app

### Step 4: Verify on Railway
1. Wait for Railway deployment to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
2. Open your production app via Expo Go
3. Login and check the dashboard
4. Verify the Dad Joke of the Day appears
